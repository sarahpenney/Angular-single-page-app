  <h2>Google ATAP ‘HELP’</h2>
  <div class='copyLeft'>
    <p>‘HELP’ combines live action and CG in a 360 environment,<br>creating an action-driven story with cinematic quality<br>visual effects.
      The team worked to solve the technical and creative challenges
      involved with immersive and VR filmmaking,<br>developing a custom 360 camera rig solution
      with the ability to follow the action.<br>
      <br>
      Shooting 360 live action footage has generally been a challenge<br>for directors,
      with most methods providing images from multiple<br>cameras with an overlapping
      wide-angle field of view.

      The Mill took on the challenge to build a comprehensive onset/dailies<br>
      type solution that was intuitive and inspired confidence on set.
      <br><br>
      After numerous tests, experimentation and R&D,<br>
      The Mill developed ‘Mill Stitch’ (TM pending), a proprietary software<br>
      solution that takes images from multiple cameras and then stitches the output<br>
      into a continuous 360 degree view. Mill Stitch proved invaluable to the process,<br>
      bringing real-time stitching, interactive controls, and record/review<br>
      to a cinematic VR production pipeline. Mill Stitch was even featured at Google I/O<br>
      sandbox so patrons could experience first hand what it would be like directing a VR film.
