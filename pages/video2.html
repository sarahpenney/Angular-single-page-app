  <h2>OFFSET London 2015 Title Sequence</h2>
  <div class='copyLeft'>
    <p>
      Mill+ Designer Aran Quinn directed the 2015 Title Sequence for OFFSET London,
      the international debut for the Dublin-based<br>design and creative conference featuring the makers,
      innovators and educators shaping the future of our visual landscape.
      <br>
      <br>
      For OFFSET’s first international conference, Aran created a title sequence
      following six characters from across the globe en route<br>to the festival in London.
      While travelling on their very own<br>custom made motorbikes, each character is carrying an individual
      <br>letter to spell out 'OFFSET'. Along the way, they each leave a<br>unique trail that transforms
      to spell out the names of the<br>18 guest speakers.

      Each character was made out of clay and hand painted four times or more to create<br>
      a boiling or flickering effect, which was inspired by a technique by fellow Irish artist Conor Finnegan.<br>
      All of the characters’ background props and the speakers’ names are cell animated and designed<br>
      to reflect the local culture of each quirky globetrotter.<br>
      <br>
      Aran comments, “I love stop motion and cell animation so I went straight for mixed media<br>
      approach as it’s my most favorable technique. It also ties into the speakers’ different backgrounds in<br>
      multidisciplinary work since the OFFSET festival covers all areas of identity projects, graphics,<br>
      print, animation, film and illustration."
